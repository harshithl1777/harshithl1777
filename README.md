### Hi there 👋 I'm Harshith!

I'm a Grade 11 student at Port Credit Secondary School and a part-time intern at Apollo.io. I've at companies like **myBlueprint** and **BlueStacks** in the past.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Roadrunner** (a middleware application for data processing between Google Sheets and Trello)
- ✅ My skills include **React, Nodejs, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, TypeScript and Python**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Ruby on Rails**
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an [email](mailto:harshithl1777@gmail.com) or check out my [Portfolio](https://harshithl.me)
- 😄 Pronouns: HE/HIM
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once stapled my ring finger by accident when I was 6. 😬 That one hurt quite a bit. On the brighter side, I'm also currently making my own Udemy course 😄
