### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harshith!

I'm a Grade 12 student at Port Credit Secondary School. I've at companies like **Apollo.io**, **myBlueprint** and **BlueStacks** in the past.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving an app called **Beacon** (a crowdsourced stock and lines data platform for consumers in the pandemic)
- âœ… My skills include **React, Nodejs, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, TypeScript and Python**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Ruby on Rails**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me an [email](mailto:harshithl1777@gmail.com)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: HE/HIM
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once stapled my ring finger by accident when I was 6. ðŸ˜¬ That one hurt quite a bit.
