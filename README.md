### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harshith!

I'm a Grade 11 student at Port Credit Secondary School and a part-time intern at Apollo.io. I've at companies like **myBlueprint** and **BlueStacks** in the past.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Roadrunner** (a middleware application for data processing between Google Sheets and Trello)
- âœ… My skills include **React, Nodejs, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, TypeScript and Python**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Ruby on Rails**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any type of fullstack development project
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UI/UX Design and Node.js (weird combo, I know)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me an [email](mailto:harshithl1777@gmail.com) or check out my [Portfolio](https://harshithl.me)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: HE/HIM
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once stapled my ring finger by accident when I was 6. ðŸ˜¬ That one hurt quite a bit. On the brighter side, I'm also currently making my own Udemy course ðŸ˜„
